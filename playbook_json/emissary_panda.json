The group has been active since at least 2010 and has targeted organizations in the aerospace, government, defense, technology, energy, and manufacturing sectors. As well as targeted attacks against other miscellaneous organizations around the world.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016 they continued to use known backdoors associated with them previously, including OwaShell & Wonknu. In 2017 & 2018 they have been notable for their targeting of Turkish organizations, and their use of older backdoors such as ZxShell and Gh0st.",

In this technique, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential Access technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems. \n\nWindows 7 and higher with KB2871997 require valid domain user credentials or RID 500 administrator hashes.

      "description": "In April 2019, we observed the APT27 threat group installing webshells on Sharepoint servers to compromise Government Organizations of two different countries in the Middle East. We believe the adversary exploited a recent vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604, which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell. We were able to detect the presence of the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers, which has also been used by the APT27 threat group. We observed this webshell activity across three SharePoint servers between April 1, 2019 and April 16, 2019, where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers. Based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells, we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as a beachhead, then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.
