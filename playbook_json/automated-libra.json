            "description": "Automated Libra has been active since at least 2020 but has shown probable presence as early as 2019. The PurpleUrchin freejacking operation is notable due to its heavy utilization of CI/CD techniques to perform its operation. Freejacking is the process of using free-to-use, or limited-time trails, of cloud resources to perform cryptomining operations. While freejacking in and of itself is not illegal, there is substantial evidence illustrating the actors' usage of Play and Run techniques, where they will use cloud resources and not pay the bill for resources offered. Automated Libra is believed to operate out of South Africa. Researchers were able to determine the physical location of the actors behind the due to information data dumps contained within the PurpleUrchin operation's extensive container infrastructure. \n",

Freejacking is the process of using free-to-use, or limited-time trails, of cloud resources to perform cryptomining operations. The PurpleUrchin operation is notable due to its heavy utilization of CI/CD techniques to perform its operation. While freejacking in and of itself is not illegal, there is substantial evidence illustrating the actors' usage of Play and Run techniques, where they will use cloud resources and not pay the bill for resources offered.
