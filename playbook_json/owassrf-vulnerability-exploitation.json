The CVE-2022-41082 vulnerability was previously used by the ProxyNotShell exploit. However, the OWASSRF exploit method bypasses mitigations previously provided by Microsoft for ProxyNotShell. OWASSRF requires authentication to the Exchange Server prior to exploitation, thus we are seeing isolated rather than mass exploitation attempts.",

Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another.

Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet. \n\nThere are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol.

For `SSL Forward Proxy` configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.\n\n1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.\n\n2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.",
