      "description": "Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.",

      "description": "An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. This may be direct code execution, such as when a user opens a malicious executable delivered via [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193) with the icon and apparent extension of a document file. It also may lead to other execution techniques, such as when a user clicks on a link delivered via [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192) that leads to exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl. \n\nAs an example, an adversary may weaponize Windows Shortcut Files (.lnk) to bait a user into clicking to execute the malicious payload.(Citation: Proofpoint TA505 June 2018) A malicious .lnk file may contain [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086) commands. Payloads may be included into the .lnk file itself, or be downloaded from a remote server.(Citation: FireEye APT29 Nov 2018)(Citation: PWC Cloud Hopper Technical Annex April 2017) \n\nWhile User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.",
