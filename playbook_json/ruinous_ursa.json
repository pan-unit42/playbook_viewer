      "description": "Beginning on Jan. 14, 2022, reports began emerging about a series of attacks targeting numerous Ukrainian government websites. As a result of these attacks, numerous government websites were found to be either defaced or inaccessible. As a result of this, the government of [Ukraine formally accused Russia](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/ukrainian-government-officially-accuses.html) of masterminding these attacks against their websites. \n\nA day later, public reporting outlined a new malware family, called [WhisperGate](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/), that originally was observed on Jan. 13, 2022. This malware family disables Windows Defender Threat Protection, is destructive in nature and was discovered to target multiple organizations in Ukraine. Microsoft has publicly attributed the use of this custom malware family to a threat actor they refer to as DEV-0586. Unit 42 refers to this threat actor as Ruinous Ursa.\n",

      "description": "Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  \n\nProcess hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as <code>CreateProcess</code>, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Leitch Hollowing)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Thread Local Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005) but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. ",

Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server. \n\nProtocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that carry web traffic may be very common in environments. HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic. ",
