These documents exploit known vulnerabilities within various desktop applications and subsequently drop malware onto the victim host. \r\n\r\nCommon [multi-stage] malware used by these operators include: AutoIT, MyDoom, Metasploit, BADNEWS, TINYTYPHON, Powershell, and key loggers. \r\n\r\nThe use of Dead Drop Resolvers to communicate with a command and control domain or IP is often seen as well as the use of cloud infrastructure by Leaseweb or BELCLOUD.  Many SSL certificates issued by Let's Encrypt have also been noted in association with their infrastructure activities. \r\n\r\nPatchwork is believed to be operating within the Indian subcontinent based on infrastructure logins within that region.
