      "description": "Clop ransomware is a variant of a previously known strain called CryptoMix. In 2019, Clop was delivered as the final payload of a phishing campaign associated with the financially motivated actor TA505. In 2020, Clop has evolved from a ransomware delivered through malicious spam to one being used in targeted campaigns against high-profile companies. Clop appends the .clop extension to the victim's files. We have observed different variants using different extensions, such as \u201c.CIIp\u201d,  \u201c.Cllp\u201d and \u201c.C_L_O_P\u201d. This ransomware includes various features to avoid detection. Observed Clop samples try to kill several processes and services related to backups and security solutions.\n\nOperators using this ransomware, typically  cxfiltratate valuable documents, before encrypting victims' files. Clop operators  demand payment in exchange for the decryption keys and a promise not to publicly leak the stolen materials. ",

      "description": "Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.
