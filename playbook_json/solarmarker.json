Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.\n\nFor example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file, <code>AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data</code> and executing a SQL query: <code>SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;</code>. The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API function <code>CryptUnprotectData</code>, which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.

This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).",

Some of its capabilities include the exfiltration of auto-fill data, saved passwords, and saved credit card information from the victim’s web browsers. In addition to capabilities belonging to regular info-stealers, SolarMarker has additional capabilities such as file transfer and command execution received from a C2 server. One of the key techniques in which it invests effort is defense evasion, which consists of techniques like signed files, huge files, impersonation of legitimate software installations, and obfuscated PowerShell scripts.\n\nThis malware has been prevalent since September 2020 targeting US companies, and part of the infrastructure is still active as of 2022.\nRecently, we've identified a new version of SolarMarker. In a recent blog post, we dived into the technical details of the newly identified activity, and specifically how this malware often changes and modifies its attack patterns,  for example - the recent version demonstrated an evolution from Windows Portable Executables (EXE files) to working with MSI files. According to the evidence we have, this campaign is still in development and we assess with medium confidence that it might go back to using executables files (EXE) as did in its earlier versions.\n",
