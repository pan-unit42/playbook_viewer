      "description": "Mespinoza, a prolific group also known as PYSA, that our Unit 42 cybersecurity consulting group has observed attacks in the U.S. on publishing, real estate, industrial manufacturing and education organizations. The FBI recently published an alert about the group following a hacking spree on K-12 schools, colleges, universities and even seminaries in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom.\n\nTo learn more about this group, we monitored its infrastructure -- including a command and control (C2) server it uses to manage attacks and a leak site where it posts data of victims who refused to pay large ransoms. Here are some key findings:\n\nMespinoza is extremely disciplined. After accessing a new network, the group\u2019s analysts study compromised systems in what we believe is triage to determine whether there\u2019s enough valuable data to justify launching a full-scale attack. They look for keywords such as \u201csecret\u201d and \u201cfraud,\u201d which suggests they are hunting for sensitive files that would have the most impact if leaked.\n\nIt is releasing data on lots of victims. The gang\u2019s leak site provided data it claims belong to 147 victim organizations, which it refers to as \u201cpartners.\u201d Use of that term suggests that they try to run the group as a professional enterprise and see victims as business partners who fund their profits.\n\nIt is taking in big money. Our consultants have observed ransom demands as high as $1.6 million and payments as high as $470,000.",

      "description": "Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. (Citation: Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.\n\nExternal connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.",

(Citation: Microsoft RunOnceEx APR 2018) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a \"Depend\" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnceEx\\0001\\Depend /v 1 /d \"C:\\temp\\evil[.]dll\"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)\n\nThe following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:\n\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders</code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders</code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders</code>\n\nThe following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:\n\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServicesOnce</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServicesOnce</code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServices</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServices</code>\n\nUsing policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:\n\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run</code>\n\nThe Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7. Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here. The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Userinit</code> and <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell</code> subkeys can automatically launch programs.\n\nPrograms listed in the load value of the registry key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows</code> run when any user logs on.\n\nBy default, the multistring <code>BootExecute</code> value of the registry key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager</code> is set to <code>autocheck autochk *</code>. This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.\n\nAdversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.",

      "description": "Mespinoza ransomware is fairly straightforward, as it enumerates the file system and encrypts files with an asymmetric cipher, renames the files with a specific extension and displays a ransom message. The ransom message contains three email addresses that victims would contact to discuss payment options for the actors to decrypt the encrypted files. In addition to providing email addresses, the ransom message also includes the group\u2019s leak site that the actors say they will post sensitive files that the actors stole from the network prior to encrypting the files. It appears that the group uses these potentially sensitive files to gain leverage in negotiating payment.\n\nMespinoza ransomware starts by creating a mutex Pysa, of which Pysa is another alias for this ransomware family. It then enumerates the file system and writes the ransom message to a file named Readme.README in each folder."

      "description": "During our analysis of a Mespinoza ransomware incident, we observed the threat actors installing a backdoor written in the Go language on the system prior to the distribution of the ransomware. According to a report published by France\u2019s National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), ANSSI also observed threat actors delivering the Mespinoza ransomware using a payload written in Go. We analyzed the Go sample mentioned in the ANSSI report and found that it was an earlier and an unobfuscated version of the same tool we observed in our case.\n\nThe developers of Gasket wrote this backdoor in Golang and used the open-source Gobfuscate tool to obfuscate the payload. We call this tool Gasket, as the variant of this tool mentioned in the ANSSI report (SHA256: 9986b6881fc1df8f119a6ed693a7858c606aed291b0b2f2b3d9ed866337bdbde) designated as version \u201c001,\u201d which had the following two functions that it called to carry out its command and control (c2) communications:\n\nmain.checkGasket\nmain.connectGasket\n\nWe believe that the actors use this backdoor as a backup to RDP to maintain access to the network."
