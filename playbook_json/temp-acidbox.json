      "description": "When the news broke in 2014 about a new sophisticated threat actor dubbed Turla, its kernelmode malware became also the first publicly described case which abuses a 3rd party device driver to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). This security mechanism was introduced in Windows Vista to prevent unsigned drivers from loading into kernel space. Turla exploited the signed VirtualBox driver VBoxDrv.sys v1.6.2 to deactivate DSE and load its unsigned payload drivers afterwards. According to the Estonian foreign intelligence service, Turla is believed to have Russian origins and operates on behalf of the FSB.\n\nThere is some confusion about this exploit as it\u2019s often generally referred to as CVE-2008-3431. Actually, the exploit used by Turla abuses two vulnerabilities of which only one was fixed in the aforementioned CVE. The other vulnerability was found by Turla authors and is used in the first version of their exploit along with CVE-2008-3431. The second version of their exploit, presumably introduced in 2014 of their kernelmode malware, only uses the unpatched vulnerability which we will discuss in more detail later.\n\nThis unpatched vulnerability can be exploited not only in VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys driver v1.6.2, but also in all other versions smaller v3.0.0. This was also discovered by a yet unknown threat actor which targeted at least two different Russian organizations in 2017. The actors used a previously unknown malware family we have dubbed AcidBox - with the first part being an anagram of the malware\u2019s driver device name and the second part taken from VirtualBox. Because of the malware\u2019s complexity, its rarity and the fact that it\u2019s part of a bigger toolset, we believe it is used by an advanced threat actor for targeted attacks.\n\nAcidBox is a complex modular toolkit of which we have only some components. The toolkit consists of 64-bit usermode DLL files - one type of which appears to be an orchestrator containing the vulnerable VirtualBox driver and the AcidBox kernelmode component embedded. The VirtualBox driver is dropped to disk, loaded, and exploited in order to load the unsigned malware driver.\n\nHow the orchestrator DLL is loaded remains unknown, we only know that a passed parameter is checked by the DLL and it wont execute properly without it. The orchestrator and the other DLL modules also depend on registry keys to be present on the system in order to fully execute. These registry paths are present as encrypted strings in the resource sections and must be created by an unknown file or dropper at an earlier stage. The registry values contain encrypted data blobs that contain additional modules to be injected into a given process as well as additional data.",

      "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.\n\nAdversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570).",

Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.\n\nSeveral types exist:\n\n### Browser-based Exploitation\n\nWeb browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) and [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.\n\n### Office Applications\n\nCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.\n\n### Common Third-party Applications\n\nOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.",
